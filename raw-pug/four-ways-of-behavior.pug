.chapter-title Four ways of behavior

p.
    Any subjective behavior belongs to one of four types of behavior.

p.
    <b>Pushing a wall</b> - the first type describes the behavior of a person that has an imagination of
    results. Such person may do lots of efforts towards its goal, she may literally work until
    pain and injuries, though we even cannot see any changes around. A person pushes a wall, but a wall stays
    here without any recognizable changes.

p.
    The reason why people do such activity lays in an assumption that huge efforts automatically rewarded with
    desired results. But that is not true. You should time to time measure changes in your target/target related
    things because otherwise you may be blinded for reality and eventually appeared to push a wall.

p.
    <b>Waves on water surface</b> - the second way of behavior describes similar personal activity with the only difference
    - we see and can measure changes in reality. So, we see waves on a water surface, we see how it moves and vibrates,
    though this is all not actually related to the desired result.

p.
    Thus, there is a catch because you may think all things going fine - you do efforts, you see changes,
    you are able to measure those changes. So, you are waiting for the result to become reality but you forget
    about the cause-consequence chain, which means your actions may not cause the desired result.

p.
    Always check what you are doing and what do you want to achieve by this. Is there a relationship between what you
    do and what you expect? Is it a probability of expected consequence or you are able to achieve results inevitably?

p.
    <b>Homo sapiens</b> - the third way of behavior shows how people live now. We use high technologies,
    apply complicated engineering and invoke large teams of professionals to build or repair something,
    to heal an organism or find better solutions for something. And we see progress around us is great.
    Every day beautiful events, advancements happen in the world. OK, it really sounds cool.

p.
    The only thing I want to mention here - we do it at the low-efficient rate. Mostly because we use human labor
    for lots of available work at all. And there are lots of human factors causing decreasing total efficiency.

p.
    Definitely human is the universal entity in the world, but because of biological (natural) limitations,
    people are not the best option for all sorts of work.

p.
    <b>UABRO</b> - as a way of behavior - assumes most efficient activity. For people living in UABRO style, the
    beauty of action lays in the maximum correlation between actual (done) work and theoretically possible smartest work.

p.
    The fourth way cannot be imagined without work done by robots. This way, people delegate understandable (something
    that may be defined by an algorithm, textual description) work for robots while keeping the focus on what is really
    hard to do - abstract thinking within frames of most dynamic and suitable tool for this - biological brain.
