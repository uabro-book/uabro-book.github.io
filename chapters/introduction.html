<div class="chapter-title">Introduction</div><p>The first statement of this book – we are technologically ready to step into the age of intelligent freedom.
But before I start to explain what the key characteristics of such age, let me take a pause to make a small introduction of this book.
</p><p>My major intention for writing this book is to explain myself and share with others knowledge collected and conclusions deduced
by me through relatively small amount of life yet. I believe it is worth to write
and read because there are definitely numbers of deep principles behind my words which make sense for people.
</p><p>Here, you will not find hundreds of funny stories that happened to me. But you will find lots of concepts and ideas, reasons and results
based on both funny and not at all stories. As a founder of UABRO organization, I want you to understand my words in most general, fundamental way and
there is no specific audience of my readers – people of any age, race, profession and from any location of the world are welcome.</p>
