<div class="chapter-title">Four ways of behavior</div><p>Any subjective behavior belongs to one of four types of behavior.
</p><p>Pushing a wall - the first type describes behavior of person that has some imagination of
results. Such person may do lots of efforts towards its goal, she may literally work until
pain and injures, though we even cannot see any changes around. Person pushes a wall, but a wall stays
here without any recognizable changes.
</p><p>The reason why people do such activity lays in assumption that huge efforts automatically rewarded with
desired results. But that is not true. You should time to time measure changes in your target/target related
things because otherwise you may be blinded for reality and eventually appeared to pushing a wall.
</p><p>Waves on water surface - the second way of behavior describes similar personal activity with the only difference
- we see and can measure changes in reality. So, we see waves on water surface, we see how it moves and vibrates,
though this is all not actually related to desired result.
</p><p>Thus, there is a catch because you may think all things going fine - you do efforts, you see changes,
you are able to measure those changes. So, you are waiting for result to become reality but you forget
about cause-consequence chain, which means your actions may not cause desired result.
</p><p>Always check what you are doing and what do you want to achieve by this. Is there relation between what you
do and what you expect? Is it a probability of expected consequence or you are able to achieve results inevitably?
</p><p>Homo sapiens - the third way of behavior shows how people live now. We use high technologies,
apply complicated engineering and invoke large teams of professionals to build or repair something,
to heal an organism or find better solutions for something. And we see progress around us is great.
Everyday beautiful events, advancements happen in the world. OK, it is really sounds cool.
</p><p>The only thing I want to mention here - we do it at low efficient rate. Mostly because we use human labor
for lots of available work at all. And there are lots of human factors causing decreasing total efficiency.
</p><p>Definitely human is most universal entity in the world, but because of biological (natural) limitations
people are not the best option for all sorts of work.
</p><p>UABRO - as a way of behavior - assumes most efficient activity. For people lived in UABRO style the
beauty of action lays in maximum correlation between actual (done) work and theoretically possible smartest work.
</p><p>The fourth way cannot be imagine without work done by robots. This way, people delegate understandable (something
that may be defined by an algorithm, textual description) work for robots while keep focus on what is really
hard to do - abstract thinking within frames of most dynamic and suitable tool for this - biological brain.</p>
