- Why we were born to live in this specific time?
- - And not 100 or 1K years later or earlier?
- - Maybe we were born earlier but don't remember it due to reincarnation?

- Program DNA easily as computer program
- - Snapshot full DNA sequence at any time
- - Rollback to any DNA snapshot at any time
- - Experiment with DNA to try to improve it - rollback to any stable version in case of failure

- What the world should look like?
- - Can an individual be more powerful than a full society?
- - Why people dedicate their time for someone else dreams?

- What is the power of people?
- - Make decisions. Not physical strength or durability.
- - Consume information, produce decision.
- - Robots should implement our decisions.

- Consciousness
- - It is only a single point at any given time.

# The way of transition
- How we transform our society into desired state?
- It is risky to invest our lives into something theoretical yet, so why to do that?
- - Invest if you cannot agree with a current state and its potential future

- Transition should be done accounting global economics and interests
- - We live in a great legacy system. The world should understand benefits of the transition to allow and support it.

# Theory of consciousness
- Consciousness is mind is soul
- Consciousness linked to an intelligent system (brain) with enough intelligent complexity in it (system requirements to install mind on a body)
- Do animals have consciousness? (cats, dogs, apes, dolphins, whales etc)

- Reincarnation is a transfer of mind to new living organism
- - When people die, neuron connections of the brain destroyed which forces mind to detach from brain because its intelligence level is below a threshold required for consciousness to be linked with a brain.
- - Mind travels around until new intelligently enough system is found (newborn people or maybe even before a birth)
- Population increasing:
- - Where new people get consciousness from?
- - - If new consciousness created somehow - new unimaginable yet theory.
- - - If it is split between new people so its concentration is lowering.
- - - If mind is integer (cannot be divided as floating number) then more and new people live without consciousness.
- Life possible only with a mind (soul, consciousness). Without mind it is only a simulation.
- - ChatGPT and other AIs are only a simulation of human. Even when AI will pass Turing's test it still will be just a simulation until a mind will be linked to this artificial brain.

- Mind is linked only to a single brain at a time.
- - What if we connect to remote cameras and other sensors (mic, temperature etc) to our brain like miles away from our body - will we perceive ourselves as a single body yet or we will start being multi-body being? (living at multiple places at the same time)
- Upcoming AI models may have enough intelligent comlexity (neurons connections) in their artificial brains for a mind to be linked with
- - Reincarnation may happen to an intelligently enough AI system
- Memories are logs of our perception from past events and imagination
- Mind, probably, is memory-less. Mind is more about human traits and intentions.
- Brain (knowledge) is just a context for our minds on how to react to the world.
- Reincarnation is a current way for immortality
- Need to create sensor device which can measure consciousness in a system to further control it
- - See where consciousness is linked
- - Keep consciousness linked to where we need
- - Prevent mind detach (when artifical brain powered off for example)

# The universe is singleton
- No multiverse
- No past, no future
- Only present exists. And only a single version of reality exists.
- Reality is a state of matter and energy.
- Past is only our memories about it. State of reality holds logs about our past.
- Future is only our imagination about it. State of reality holds possible next state of reality.
- Time does not exist. No time-travel in its classical understanding.
- Time is a virtual concept to describe changes of part of reality relatively to other parts of reality. In most physical systems time compared to speed of light, which means 1 second is a change of state of light in reality equal to 299 792 458 meters of distance.
- So you cannot travel back in time as there is no past. The only pseudo-theoretically possible thing here is to make state of reality to be same as in the past, which is practically impossibly for the whole universe as it is too big and no energy enough to rollback state of reality:
- - Because we cannot store snapshot of state of whole universe as the universe itself is the only storage we have. No additional storages available, no where to store snapshots, no where to get snapshots from. Theoretically, we can snapshot only a part of state of reality.

# Technology is the reason for consiousness
People created technology to avoid necessary work so we can focus on what inspires and extends us.
We don't need to hunt food anymore, because technology allows us to produce enough food and energy and process materials to create clothes and buildings, and maintaing infrastructure, and seemlessly and instantly communicate globally.

Thousand years ago it was not possible.
Nowadays, we can actually live lives.
We can search the purpose and implement it and go deeper than ever in our thoughts and understanding.
Technology extends our capabilities which causes extension of our consciosness.

Without technologies we will loose all our focus on basic life-keeping things like food, home and safety.
