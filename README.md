Modern philosophy requires modern approach:
* git repo instead of printed papers
* interactive website for efficient exploration and individual experience

## Disclaimer

Ideas, concepts and exact phrases you may find in this book or its git commits history should be perceived with the best intentions.
Exact words I used to explain something may actually not be properly used and should be refactored or even bug fixed.
Please let me know if you find such words so I can review them.

# About Oleksii, author of this book

https://shnyra.com/

I am highly skilled professional software engineer and therefore a huge fan of:
* developing, refactoring and bug fixing systems to make our lives better, reaching levels not available before
* - such levels were available before in theory, as laws of nature do not change, but not available in practice as they require lots of inventions and efforts in software, hardware, legal and other aspects of our lives.
