- Time neither exists as phenomena nor dimension.
Time is a contextual synonym for term "changes".

Difference between subjective and objective worlds.

Characteristics of subjective world:
- Belongs to particular person (individual) - subject.
- Has perspective (e.g. further objects seems small though may be bigger than subject).
- Perceived by subject through its own filters - gained knowledge and current emotional state.
- Tends to optimize things.
- Tends to efficiency and performance.

Characteristics of objective world:
- Consists of matter and energy.
- No optimization can be applied.

Assumptions:
- There is observable part of objective world known to subject.
- Subject cares about observable part of the world.
- People are carriers of consciousness.

----------------------
Things to remember:
- There are processes you can control, and processes you cannot
- There is state of matter you can predict, and state you cannot anticipate

--------------------
Any human language consists of words describing the same relationships of ideas but in different contexts.
I am trying to simplify lots of terms to express my thoughts as directly as I can by introducing my own terminology.
All terms which not defined in this book should be understood in general way.

Most important terms are:
- system - somehow related elements.
- element - particle of the system, related to other element(s) of the system.
- relation - function (rule) describing how changes of one element's state reflect changes on state of other element within system.

People are subjects. That's why they tend to optimize things.
That's why people separate one big (subjectively unprocessable) into numbers of smaller (processable) systems.

--------------------
State of matter - particular order of matter. As a snapshot of the universe or its part.

Time - changes of the state of matter.
# each moment of time a change happened. Each particle of the matter changes its characteristics (location, energy amount)
# there is no time as a separate dimension. Time not exists. Word time is a synonym for changes.

--------------------
UABRO is for people that continuously create something.

--------------------
Science. Better materials - materials with bigger range (new higher, lower levels) of their properties:
- density
- conductivity
- elasticity
- reflection, refraction
- chemical interactions (e.g. oxidation)
- magnetism
- threshold conditions between state of matter transitions
- radioactivity

----------------------
Biological organisms are very interesting because/and complicated.
For example, automated devices (nowadays robots, computers) are just fine with some electricity.
Provide electricity and your device will work for long.

But organisms, especially like humans, are so complicated. There are no universal (yet) material/energy that
fully covers all human's needs. Each organism daily requires lots of different components (micro elements, vitamins etc.).
Small portions, but the point is in diversity of ingredients.

---------------------
The beauty of life. Anything in the world shares one simple and inevitable property - dynamism.
Every single system is under attack by all surrounded systems.
The only reason a system keeps alive is because its regeneration processes bigger than all destructive effects on it.
Life wihtout any risks is possible only in a static world, in a snapshot.
But the real world is only dynamic. Therefore, there are infite wars throughout the matter to survive, to thrive.
